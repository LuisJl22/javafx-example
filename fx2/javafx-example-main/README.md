# JavaFX Ball Animation Example
This is an example of a ball moving around a JavaFX pane. 

The project uses the basic JavaFX framework of an App file that extends Application, and a start function.

A Pane is created with a Scene, and a Circle object is added to it. 

Basic timeline animation is used to animate the ball.

Add your own modifications to play around with JavaFX.
